# ReadLerc-JS - Read Lerc2 v3 in javascript

## What is LERC?

LERC is an open-source image or raster format which supports rapid encoding and decoding for any pixel type (not just RGB or Byte) designed by [esri](https://github.com/Esri/lerc).

## Why this project?

The original project just provides Lerc2 encoder and Lerc1 decoder(js), so I migrate its C++ implementation(part of) to javascript.

## How to use

1.Copy code from lib/dist folder.

## Test

Run mocha to test.
